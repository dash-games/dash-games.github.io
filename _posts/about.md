﻿﻿### ﻿﻿  What is Dash?Dash is a game launcher. Dash will fetch boxarts and metadata for any game, from any service (emulated games too!) Dash is a hardware abstraction layer for controllers. You press the buttons, Dash will translate that into configurable actions. -  If an emulator is running, left bumper + back could be configured to create a save state. -  If the Windows desktop is active, with no games running, the Guide button could be configured to open the Start Menu. -  If a controller is connected, Dash indicates the battery state.### What makes Dash different?Dash is coded in C#, and is made for (**and on**) windows 10. This means I  can take advantage of Windows 10 technologies.  That said... I'd like to get rid of the keyboard & mouse based UI entirely. I would like to reach a point that Dash can stop falling back to the desktop entirely.
