# Roadmap

An overview of upcoming work on over the next few months.

As a caveat - this is a living doc, and will evolve as priorities grow and shift. The Dash project will always be adapting to new use-cases and evolutions in the platform - this roadmap is more of a working guide of what's being worked on than a strict timeline.

### Windows 10 Optimization

I'm working on a guide and accompanying scripts, tasks, and registry files to deploy a stable performance oriented setup for gaming on Windows 10. I wont be covering overclocking or anything scary, just the basics. This is only to help tune Windows 10 for a more console-like setup. More info will be announced here as possible.

### Website Changes

I've recently launched a website for Dash! I'll working on it as needed going forth.

*Goals*:

- Ensure everything is responsive and looks right
  - ✔️ Navigation bar is responsive
  - ✔️ Hero Image is (mostly) responsive

### Dash

Dash is currently on [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2050460584/dash?ref=7f05s1)! Look for beta builds coming soon.

### What's next?

Currently finishing up the website. I'll be posting ideas and plans here. I'd like to get this finished and then begin work on getting the windows abstraction layer ready for testing.


### Community and Ecosystem

I'm starting to build the Dash community. More details will be added here as they become available.

*Goals*:

- Increase Dash + Community engagement.
  - Tighten the core development and community feedback loop - better evolve Dash as the community evolves.
  - Publish all elements to github for community review.
  - Regularly publish project and roadmap updates.
  - Work with community members to help drive elements forward.
